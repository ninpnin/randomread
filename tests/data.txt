 anarchism is an anti authoritarian political and social philosophy that rejects hierarchies deemed unjust and advocates their replacement with self managed self governed societies based on voluntary cooperative institutions these institutions are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non hierarchical or free associations anarchism s central disagreement with other ideologies is that it holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful anarchism is usually placed on the far left of the political spectrum and much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications etymology terminology and definition the etymological origin of the word anarchism is from the ancient greek word anarkhia meaning without a ruler composed of the prefix a i e without and the word arkhos i e leader or ruler the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy the word anarchism appears in english from one six four two as anarchisme and the word anarchy from one five three nine various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists many revolutionaries of the one nine th century such as william godwin one seven five six one eight three six and wilhelm weitling one eight zero eight one eight seven one would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon one eight zero nine one eight six five marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid one nine th century since the one eight nine zero s and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently hence it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization including the state capitalism nationalism and all associated institutions in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on voluntary association on freedom and on decentralisation but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology which is simply a negation of a ruler or based on anti statism anarchism is much more than that or even the anti authoritarian which is an a posteriori conclusion nonetheless major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following the will for a non coercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non coercive society a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy history prehistoric and ancient world zeno of citium c three three four c two six two bc whose republic inspired peter kropotkin during the prehistoric era of mankind an established authority did not exist it was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction most notable examples of anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece in china philosophical anarchism meaning peaceful delegitimizing of the state was delineated by taoist philosophers i e zhuangzi and lao tzu likewise in greece anarchist attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness cynics dismissed human law nomos and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature physis stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state during the middle ages there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the islamic world or in christian europe this kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism in persia a zoroastrian prophet known as mazdak was calling for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy but he soon found himself executed by the king in basra religious sects preached against the state in europe various sects developed anti state and libertarian tendencies those currents were the precursor of religious anarchism in the centuries to come it was in the renaissance and with the spread of reasoning and humanism through europe that libertarian ideas emerged writers were outlining in their novels ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism the enlightenment further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress modern era the turning point towards anarchism was the french revolution in which the anti state and federalist sentiments began to take a form mostly by enrag s and sans culottes some prominent figures of anarchism begun developing the first anarchist currents that is the era of classical anarchism that lasted until the end of the spanish civil war of one nine three six and was the golden age of anarchism william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimizing the state max stirner s thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre joseph proudhon s theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france upright anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists mikhail bakunin took mutualism and extended it to collectivist anarchism bakunin s current jura federation entered the class worker union called the international workingmen s association iwa later known as the first international formed in one eight six four to unite diverse revolutionary currents due to its links to active workers movements the international became a significant organisation karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings bakunin s followers entered a bitter dispute with marx which ended in one eight seven two with the split of the workers movement that officially took place in hague the major reason lay in fundamentally different approaches on how the workers would emancipate themselves marx was advocating for the creation of a political party to take part in electoral struggles whereas bakunin thought that the whole set of marx s thinking was very authoritarian bakunin is famous for predicting that if such a party would gain power by marxist s terms it would end up to be the new tyrant of workers after being expelled from the iwa anarchists formed the st imier international under the influence of peter kropotkin a russian philosopher and scientist anarcho communism overlapped with collectivism anarcho communists who drew inspiration from the one eight seven one paris commune advocated for free federation and distribution of goods according to one needs the major argument of anarcho communism was that bakunian perspective would lead to antagonism among collectives at the turning of the century anarchism had spread all over the world in china small groups of students imported the humanistic pro science version of anarcho communism tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east pouring into japanese capital to study in latin america s o paulo was a stronghold and anarcho syndicalism was the most prominent left wing ideology during that time a minority of anarchists embarked into utilizing of violence in order to achieve their political ends this kind of strategy is called propaganda of the deed the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts anarchists were persecuted and given bad fame illegalism stealing the possessions of the rich because capitalists were not their rightful owners was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during those same years nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution during the revolution anarchists had concerns but they opted to support the revolution instead of the whites however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilized anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks anarchists from petrograd and moscow instead fled to ukraine the kronstadt rebellion and nestor makhno s struggle in the free territory were the most notable examples with the anarchists being crushed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism platformists sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw the bolshevik success as setting an example and communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states members of the major syndicalist movements of the general confederation of labour and industrial workers of the world iww left the organisations and joined the communist international in the spanish civil war anarchists and syndicalists cnt and fai once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists spain had a long anarchist tradition and anarchists played an important role in the war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named may days as joseph stalin tried to seize control of the republicans post world war ii era rojava is supporting efforts for workers to form cooperatives such as this sewing cooperative in the first years after world war ii the anarchist movement was severely damaged however the one nine six zero s witnessed a revival of anarchism the main causes of such a revival may have been the perceived failure of marxism leninism and the tension build by the cold war during this era anarchism was mostly part of other movements critical to both the state and capitalism such as the anti nuclear environmental and pacifist movements the new left or the counterculture of the one nine six zero s anarchism was also associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the one nine six zero s around the turn of the two one st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight g eight and the world economic forum wef some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the wto conference in seattle in one nine nine nine anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in chiapas mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern syria anarchist schools of thought anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil recognising equality of entitlement in a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the one nine th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid two zero th century and after beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del m rmol in one eight eight nine in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i e collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought the various anarchist schools of thought or currents are not distinct entities but intermingle with each other classical upright pierre joseph proudhon was the primary proponent of anarcho mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers collectivist and communist anarchism and anarcho syndicalism are all considered to be forms of social anarchism mutualism and individualism were the other notable anarchist currents through the one nine th and early two zero th century social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid mutualism mutualism began in one eight th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself with the socialist factions of the workers movement during his life of public service he began advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives and promoting certain nationalisation schemes mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property which we call liberty collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho collectivism and referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most at the epicentre of collectivist anarchism lies the belief in the potential of humankind for goodness and solidarity which will flourish when oppressive governments are abolished collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed to inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production however collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism this position was criticised by anarcho communists as effectively upholding the wages system collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but it opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need anarcho communism upright peter kropotkin was influential in the development of anarcho communism anarcho communism also known as anarchist communism communist anarchism and libertarian communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but it was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro organisationalist and insurrectionary anti organisationalist sections to date the best known examples of an anarcho communist society i e established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in one nine three six anarcho communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of catalonia along with the republicans it was crushed by the combined forces of the francisco franco s nationalists adolf hitler and benito mussolini as well as repression by the communist party of spain backed by the soviet union and economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself anarcho syndicalism may day two zero one zero demonstration of spanish anarcho syndicalist trade union cnt in bilbao basque country anarcho syndicalism also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement anarcho syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers self management anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position will allow workers to liberate themselves moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be self managing they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement he outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his one nine three eight pamphlet anarcho syndicalism the international workers association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries the spanish cnt played and still plays a major role in the spanish labour movement it was also an important force in the spanish civil war individualist anarchism individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but it instead refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict in one seven nine three william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice a book which some consider the first expression of anarchism godwin was a philosophical anarchist and from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good alt max stirner here in a sketch by friedrich engels is usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner stirner s the ego and its own published in one eight four four is a founding text of the philosophy according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirner s philosophy it was re discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist john henry mackay josiah warren was a pioneer american anarcho individualist who drew inspiration from proudhon henry david thoreau one eight one seven one eight six two was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist he is best known for his books walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings as well as his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state benjamin tucker later fused stirner s egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists and nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others post classical and contemporary lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors with zerzan being a prominent voice within anarcho primitivism and jarach a noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti globalization movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation as the movement shaped two one st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism s historical association with chaos and violence though its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches anti capitalism stays prominent within contemporary anarchism continuing the tradition of classical anarchism anarcho pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul anarcho transhumanism is a recently new branch of anarchism that takes traditional and modern anarchism typically drawing from anarcho syndicalism left libertarianism or libertarian socialism and combines it with transhumanism and post humanism it can be described as a liberal democratic revolution at its core the idea that people are happiest when they have rational control over their lives reason science and technology provide one kind of control slowly freeing us from ignorance toil pain disease and limited lifespans aging some anarcho transhumanists might also follow technogaianism free market anarchism or market anarchism includes several branches of anarchism that advocate an economic system based on voluntary market interactions without the involvement of the state certain individualist anarchists and mutualists supported this economic system left wing market anarchism is a modern branch of free market anarchism which strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti capitalist anti corporatist anti hierarchical and pro labour positions in economics anti imperialism in foreign policy and thoroughly radical views regarding cultural issues such as gender sexuality and race green anarchism or eco anarchism is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology writing from a green anarchist perspective john zerzan attributes the ills of today s social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization while layla abdelrahim argues that the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby institutionalize violence according to abdelrahim civilisation was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics language and literacy she claims are some of these technologies insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses insurrectionary anarchists instead advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation as well as putting value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda s organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the one nine one seven october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement s failures during the russian revolution post anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought drawing from diverse ideas including post left anarchy postmodernism autonomism postcolonialism and the situationist international post left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism s relationship to traditional left wing politics some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international post left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation queer anarchism is a theory that suggests anarchism as a solution to the issues faced by the lgbt community mainly heteronormativity homophobia transphobia and biphobia it arose during the late two zero th century based on the work of michel foucault s the history of sexuality one nine seven six religious anarchism refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of religions while many anarchists have traditionally been sceptical of and opposed to organized religion many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism most notably christianity as christian anarchists believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy other examples include buddhist anarchism jewish anarchism and most recently neopaganism synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the one nine two zero s this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists voline and s bastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations anarcha feminism anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism it generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state in essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa anarcha feminists espoused to a detailed analysis of patriarchy and claim that oppression has its roots to social norms anarcha feminism began with the late one nine th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre mujeres libres was an anarchist women s organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women based on the idea of a double struggle for women s liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists the second wave of anarcha feminism arose in the one nine six zero s anarcho capitalism anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self ownership in a free market anarcho capitalism developed from radical american anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory however the overall consensus among anarchists believes that anarcho capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement which opposes private property over the means of production and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms internal issues and debates as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought and disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common its diversity has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory for instance the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism collectivism and trade unionism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology e g within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others on a tactical level propaganda of the deed was used by anarchists in the one nine th century e g the nihilist movement with some contemporary anarchists espousing alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and cryptography to bring about an anarchist society about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones topics of interest intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory anarchism and free love upright french individualist anarchist mile armand propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early two zero th century an important current within anarchism is free love in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was mile armand he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults he was also a consistent proponent of polyamory in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality more recently the british anarcho pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex the issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as th orie du corps amoureux pour une rotique solaire two zero zero zero and l invention du plaisir fragments cyr aniques two zero zero two anarchism and education upright francesc ferrer i gu rdia catalan anarchist pedagogue and free thinker english anarchist william godwin considered education an important aspect he was against state education as he considered those schools as a way of the state to replicate privileges of the ruling class godwin thought that education was the way to change the world in his political justice he criticises state sponsored schooling and advocates for child s protection from coercion max stirner wrote in one eight four two a long essay on education called the false principle of our education in which stirner was advocating for child s autonomy in one nine zero one catalan anarchist and free thinker francesc ferrer i gu rdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church ferrer s approach was secular rejecting both the state and church involvement in the educational process and gave pupils plenty of autonomy i e on setting the curriculum ferrer was aiming to educate the working class the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later on arrested ferrer s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools in the united states russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate tolstoy s educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture he thought that education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself education is culture under restraint culture is free education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture a more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches experiments in germany led to a s neill founding what became summerhill school in one nine two one summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead anarchism and the state objection to the state and its institutions is sine qua non of anarchism anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and it is illegitimate regardless of political tendencies instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by a small elite authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless if it is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people another anarchist argument against states is that some people constituting a government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption anarchists consider the argument that the state is the collective will of people as a fairy tale since the ruling class is distinct from the rest of the society which forms of violence if any are consistent with anarchist values is a controversial subject among anarchists image is of leon czolgosz s assassinating american president william mckinley anarchism and violence anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexed and controversial on one hand anarcho pacifists point out the unity of means and ends on the other hand other groups of anarchist are for direct action that can include sabotage or even terrorism emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence were arguing that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil peace activist and anarchist april carter argues that violence is incompatible with anarchism because it is mostly associated with the state and authority as violence is immanent to the state as the state s capability to exercise violence is colossal nowadays a rebellion or civil war would probably end in another authoritarian institute anarchist strategies and tactics a broad categorization would be the preference of revolutionary tactics to destroy oppressive states and institutions or aiming to change society through evolutionary means revolutionary methods can take violent form as they did in past insurgencies i e in spain mexico and russia or during violent protests by militant protestors such as the black bloc who are generally much less violent than revolutionary movements a century ago anarchists also commonly employ direct action which can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchies or the form of self managing their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and non hierarchical collectives often decision making is handled in an anti authoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism another aspect of anarchist tactics is their aim to strengthen social bonds through common actions reclaiming public space by anarchists is another method of creating social spaces and creating squats in order to organise themselves during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones criticism moral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism tacit authoritarianism and vandalism towards feats of civilisation allegation of utopianism anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics often in general and formal debate european history professor carl landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force he also argued that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity however an anarchist faq states the following anarchy is not a utopia and anarchists make no such claims about human perfection remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods for example the use of juries mutual third parties or community and workplace assemblies it also states that some sort of court system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens industrial civilisation in his essay on authority friedrich engels claimed that radical decentralisation promoted by anarchists would destroy modern industrial civilisation citing an example of railways and making the following point in the end it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished tacit authoritarianism the anarchist tendency known as platformism has been criticised by situationists

with social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior parents usually notice signs during the first three years of their child s life these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections such as rubella toxins including valproic acid alcohol cocaine pesticides lead and air pollution fetal growth restriction and autoimmune diseases controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypothesis which has been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm five combines autism and less severe forms of the condition including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been cases of children who recovered not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some are successful an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder globally autism is estimated to affect two four eight million people in the two zero zero zero s the number of people affected was estimated at one two per one zero zero zero people worldwide in the developed countries about one five of children are diagnosed with asd from zero seven in two zero zero zero in the united states it occurs four to five times more often in males than females the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the one nine six zero s which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved characteristics autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person s own emotions children with high functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and meltdowns communication about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in a pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged eight one five performed equally well as and as adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends repetitive behavior alt sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line a young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs r categorizes as follows stereotyped behaviors repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behaviors time consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in a specific order checking things or hand washing sameness resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors restricted interests interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus such as preoccupation with a single television program toy or game self injury behaviors such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated zero five to one zero of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over nine zero of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated six zero eight zero of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults there is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism these are linked to greater social impairment irritability behavior and sleep problems language impairments and mood changes causes it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur alt three diagrams of chromosome pairs a b that are nearly identical one b is missing a segment of a two b has two adjacent copies of a segment of a three b s copy of a s segment is in reverse order deletion one duplication two and inversion three are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is zero seven for autism and as high as zero nine for asd and siblings of those with autism are about two five times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than one of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and x linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often such as the imprinted brain theory and the extreme male brain theory maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd in both term and preterm infants maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism the latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children mechanism autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies there is evidence that gut brain axis abnormalities may be involved a two zero one five review proposed that immune dysregulation gastrointestinal inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction a two zero one six review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the dsm five autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay icd one zero uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi r is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as landau kleffner syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated four zero of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile x testing a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age one four months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most three zero weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits girls are often diagnosed later than boys underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from one five to three zero months of age the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age one eight months and about four fifths notice by age two four months according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome no response to name or eye to eye gaze by six months no babbling by one two months no gesturing pointing waving etc by one two months no single words by one six months no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by two four months loss of any language or social skills at any age the united states preventive services task force in two zero one six found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at one eight and two four months using autism specific formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers m chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on m chat and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged one eight three zero months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features prevention while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than one of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases management alt a young child points in front of a woman who smiles and points in the same direction a three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment services should be carried out by behavior analysts special education teachers speech pathologists and licensed psychologists studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care communication and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability inattention or repetitive behavior patterns education educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention eibi a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young children is currently low and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment early intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive and global functioning in preschool children it is well established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group similarly a teacher implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers medication medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails they may also be used for associated health problems such as adhd or anxiety more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are fda approved for treating associated aggressive and self injurious behaviors however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically side effects for example may include weight gain tiredness drooling and aggression ssri antidepressants such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance some alternative treatments may place the child at risk the preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein free diets as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin d however suboptimal bone development in asd has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders in two zero zero five botched chelation therapy killed a five year old child with autism chelation is not recommended for people with asd since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy a mixture of homeopathy supplements and vaccine detoxing although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism as of two zero one eight there is no good evidence to recommend a gluten and casein free diet as a standard treatment a two zero one eight review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism such as those with known food intolerances or allergies or with food intolerance markers the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten and casein free diet in children with asd four in total all of them compared gluten and casein free diet versus normal diet with a control group two double blind randomized controlled trials one double blind crossover trial one single blind trial in two of the studies whose duration was one two and two four months a significant improvement in asd symptoms efficacy rate five zero was identified in the other two studies whose duration was three months no significant effect was observed the authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the asd symptoms other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet small sample size the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions verbal communication and non verbal communication skills there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects prognosis there is no known cure children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from three to two five most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age few high quality studies address long term prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above five zero and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism many individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job about half of people in their two zero s with autism are not employed epidemiology alt bar chart versus time the graph rises steadily from one nine nine six to two zero zero seven from about zero seven to about five three the trend curves slightly upward reports of autism cases per one zero zero zero children grew dramatically in the us from one nine nine six to two zero zero seven it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in rates of autism most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of one two per one zero zero zero for autism and close to six per one zero zero zero for asd as of two zero zero seven a two zero one six survey in the united states reported a rate of two five per one zero zero zero children for asd globally autism affects an estimated two four eight million people while asperger syndrome affects a further three seven two million in two zero one two the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged one eight years and over in the uk was one one rates of pdd nos s has been estimated at three seven per one zero zero zero asperger syndrome at roughly zero six per one zero zero zero and childhood disintegrative disorder at zero zero two per one zero zero zero cdc estimates about one out of five nine one seven for two zero one four an increase from one out of every six eight children one five for two zero one zero the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the one nine nine zero s and early two zero zero zero s this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics boys are at higher risk for asd than girls the sex ratio averages four three one and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to two one with intellectual disability and more than five five one without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism they include genetic disorders about one zero one five of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders intellectual disability the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from two five to seven zero a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum in comparison for pdd nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of asperger s excludes intellectual disability anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from one one to eight four many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd s symptoms epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population preempted diagnoses although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis history upright zero eight portrait of victor of aveyron a feral child caught in one seven nine eight who displayed possible symptoms of autism a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of a one two year old boy who may have been severely autistic luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in a one seven four seven court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair s marriage to gain blair s inheritance the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in one seven nine eight showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in one nine one zero as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word aut s meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance a soviet child psychiatrist grunya sukhareva described a similar syndrome that was published in russian in one nine two five and in german in one nine two six clinical development and diagnoses upright alt balding man in his early six zero s in coat and tie with a serious but slightly smiling expression leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three the word autism first took its modern sense in one nine three eight when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until one nine eight one leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a one nine four three report of one one children with striking behavioral similarities almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism he was diagnosed by kanner after being first examined in one nine three eight and was labeled as case one triplett was noted for his savant abilities particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers his father oliver described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns music notes letters of the alphabet and u s president pictures by the age of two he had the ability to recite the two three rd psalm and memorized two five questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism he was also interested in creating musical chords kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late one nine six zero s autism was established as a separate syndrome terminology and distinction from schizophrenia as late as the mid one nine seven zero s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism while in two zero zero seven it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child s autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research it took until one nine eight zero for the dsm iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia in one nine eight seven the dsm iii r provided a checklist for diagnosing autism in may two zero one three the dsm five was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders the grouping of disorders including pdd nos autism asperger syndrome rett syndrome and cdd has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and or interaction and restricted and or repetitive behaviors the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being society and culture an autistic culture has emerged accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements events include world autism awareness day autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include autism speaks autism national committee and autism society of america social science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements while most autistic individuals do not have savant skills many have been successful in their fields autism rights movement the autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome this perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views the medical perspective that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene s and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines a common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are high functioning or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of low functioning autistic people employment about half of autistics are unemployed and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed among autistics who find work most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees a majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children references external

various surface conditions albedo meaning whiteness is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body e g a planet like earth it is dimensionless and measured on a scale from zero corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation to one corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance flux per unit area received by a surface the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth s surface these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence i e for a given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages unless given for a specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between zero three and three m this spectrum includes visible light zero four zero seven m which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark e g trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright e g snow reflects most radiation albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management e g as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design leed program for sustainable rating of buildings the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is three zero three five because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his one seven six zero work photometria terrestrial albedo any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about zero nine for fresh snow to about zero zero four for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of zero one to zero four the average albedo of earth is about zero three this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds upright one two two zero zero three two zero zero four mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite not all directions a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about one five c if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below four zero c if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about zero c in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water a so called ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost two seven c white sky black sky and blue sky albedo for land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle i can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and the bi hemispherical reflectance bar sometimes referred to as white sky albedo with being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle and being the proportion of diffuse illumination the actual albedo also called blue sky albedo can then be given as one d bar alpha theta i d bar this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface astronomical albedo the a
